# NASA-JPL-Final-Presentation
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory APX Final Presentation - as part of my role as Systems Engineering APX for Group 312C at JPL.

These Powerpoint slides document a number of my personal contributions and work efforts over the course of my Graduate Academic Employment with NASA JPL.

These slides have been approved for release by JPL and do not contain confidential/export-controlled information.

The two files are identical - one is PDF and one is PPT format depending on user preference.
